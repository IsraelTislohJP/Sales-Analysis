**Sales Analysis by Month, Year, and Product Subcategory in R**

This project involves analyzing sales data to explore trends across different months, years, and product subcategories using R.

**Project Overview**

In this project, I conducted a detailed analysis of sales data to identify trends and patterns over time and across different product subcategories. The key steps involved include:

**Data Importation**: The dataset was imported, and necessary packages were loaded.

**Data Preprocessing**: The dataset was cleaned and organized for analysis, including handling missing values and formatting dates.
**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Sales trends were explored across various dimensions:
**Monthly Sales**: Analyzed sales patterns by month to identify seasonal trends.
**Yearly Sales**: Examined sales data over multiple years to observe growth or decline.
**Product Subcategory Analysis**: Investigated sales performance across different product subcategories.
**Visualization**: Used two main plots (line chart and lollipop chart) to visualize the trends and insights derived from the data.

**sales_analysis.R**: The R script containing all steps of the analysis.

**sales_data.csv**: The dataset used for the analysis.

**Requirements**

R (version 4.0 or above)

tidyverse package

ggplot2 package

The dataset used in this project is a hypothetical sales dataset for demonstration purposes.
